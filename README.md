# ATM machine

## Description
> This is an ATM project. This small program let you deposit of withdraw money. But be careful, you can only withdraw money if you have enough funds on your bank account. 
> It is an upgrade from an homework with MIT xpro. The main difference with the vanilla version is that the user can't withdraw more money than he has on his bank account. I also deeply modified the CSS file using React Bootstrap.

## Installation
> You Should download the different files and keep them in their respective folders. Then, run the html file within your browser.

## Usage
> Just load the page and select an action to continue. You can either depositif or withdraw money. You have to change the value in order to do an action. Press submit to add or take money from your bank account 

## Support
> If you need some help to make this exercise clearer, you can send me an email : timothee.huerne@gmail.com or reach out to me on LinkedIn : TimothÃ©e Huerne.

## Roadmap
> There are a bumch of functions you could add. It is possible to create a second account and to transfer the money from one account to the other.
 
## Licence
> The code exercise was provided by MIT XPro. I completed the exercise in order to make the Pacman move.
